## Try the demo
You can run this as a container by pulling the images from  [`rmsubekti/epicpaste`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rmsubekti/epicpaste)  on your local computer or online development lab.

Default login:
- username : `epicpaster`
- password: `5uperSecret`

or you can register an account for yourself.

For other configuration see [`rmsubekti/epicpaste` on the dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rmsubekti/epicpaste).

### Try it on your local computer
1. Open a terminal
2. Create folder 
   ```
   mkdir epicpaste && cd epicpaste
   ```
3. Run this command on terminal
   ```
   wget https://rmsubekti.github.io/compose/epicpaste/compose.yml && docker compose up
   ```

### Try it on Docker Playground

1. Login to https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
2. Create new instance
3. Run on terminal 

   ```
   wget https://rmsubekti.github.io/compose/epicpaste/compose.yml && docker compose up
   ```
4. Click open port button and type `80`

To make swagger UI working properly, you need to replace `default hostname` with hostname generated by docker playground like so:

```
domain=longDomainNameGeneratedByDockerPlayGround.WithoutHTTPProtocol
sed -i -e "s/localhost/$domain/g" compose.yml && docker compose up
```
